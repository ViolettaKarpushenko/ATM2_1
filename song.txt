Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here, 
We was hitchhikin down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon.
In the middle of the road.
And he said:
"Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul." (soul)

Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
And we each said. "Okay."
